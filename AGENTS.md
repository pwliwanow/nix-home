# Agent Guide

## Commit Process

- Git unstage all files.
- Organize changes into multiple, separate commits, if applicable.
- Use subject line format: `scope(package): Imperative summary`. Keep the
  subject concise. Then, write details below the subject line.
- **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** DO NOT include references to Claude or AI tools in
  commit messages such as "Generated with [Claude Code]" or "Co-Authored-By:
  Claude"
